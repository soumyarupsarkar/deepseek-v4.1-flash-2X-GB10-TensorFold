## GLM-5.3-Flash on Apple Silicon

The MLX engine of `glm5_next` (`src/tensorfold/families/glm5_next/`: the forward pass in `model.py`, `kda.py`,
`mla.py` and `mlp.py`, the draft head in `mtp.py`, `runtime.py`) and its Metal kernels
(`src/tensorfold/kernels/glm/flash/v1/`) are written for TensorFold. What they follow or port:

- The forward pass follows, op for op on its prefill path, the GLM-5.3-Flash (`glm5_next`)
  implementation added to [mlx-vlm](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm) by PR #2030 (by Lazarus-931; MIT License,
  Copyright (c) 2025 Prince Canuma), as vendored by [oMLX](https://github.com/jundot/omlx) (Apache-2.0). Nothing is
  imported from either at runtime.
- `kernels/glm/flash/v1/kda.py` is ported from mlx-vlm PR #2105 ("glm5_next: fuse the KDA decode chain into one
  Metal kernel", by avlp12; `mlx_vlm/models/glm5_next/fused_kda.py`; closed without merging, MIT License,
  Copyright (c) 2025 Prince Canuma): the whole KDA decode step in one Metal kernel. TensorFold runs a window of
  rows in order inside the launch, folds the 4-bit `f_b` / `g_b` projections in with MLX's one-row `qmv_quad`
  arithmetic, and keeps its own rounding points. Its precision rules (precise exp, uncontracted sums of squares)
  are also used in `fused.py`, `moe.py` and `hc.py`.
- `kernels/glm/flash/v1/sparse_attention.py` is mlx-vlm's `indexed_sparse_attention` kernel
  (`mlx_vlm/models/sparse_attention.py`) as extended by mlx-vlm PR #2245 ("Fix GLM-5.3 cached decode batch
  invariance", by raullenchai; closed without merging, MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025 Prince Canuma), adapted to
  TensorFold's single latent cache.
- mlx-vlm PR #2107 (the sparse indexer's incremental decode and a stale-pool fix, by avlp12) needed no code:
  TensorFold's cache already pools once per completed block. Its stale-pool case is pinned by
  `tests/test_glm5_ported_kernels.py`.
- The hyper-connection kernel `_HC_SPLIT` in `kernels/glm/flash/v1/kernels.py`, and the sinkhorn and collapse in
  `hc.py`, repeat the `hc_sinkhorn_collapse` kernel of mlx-vlm's `mlx_vlm/models/deepseek_v4/hyper_connection.py`
  (MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 Apple Inc.), with its output type set to the input's.
- The 4-bit matvec `_QMV_ROWS` in `kernels.py` is Flash Next's `qmv_rows` with MLX's group-64 scale indexing, and
  the expert kernels (`_EXPERT_GROUP`, `_EXPERT_QMV`) follow Flash Next's `expert_group` / `grouped_gateup`. The
  row kernels in `kernels.py`, `moe.py` and `hc.py` repeat the arithmetic and partitions of MLX 0.32's own kernels (MIT
  License, Copyright © 2023 Apple Inc.): `qmv_fast`, `qmv_quad` and `gather_qmv_fast` (`quantized.h`), `GEMVKernel`
  and `GEMVTKernel` (`gemv.h`) and the `rms_norm` kernels, one row per grid slice with the tiling MLX picks for one
  row, so each row keeps MLX's one-row bits.

## CUDA

CUDA backends use [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), BSD-3-Clause, and
[Triton](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton), MIT, supplied by NVIDIA's container rather than bundled.
Dense Qwen implements mlx-lm's model math. CUDA DFlash2 implementations port z-lab's architecture under
the MIT License, Copyright © 2026 Z Lab.

Flash Next implements transformers' model math under the attribution above. Its new DeltaNet kernel
follows flash-linear-attention's numerics, MIT; its NCCL wrapper follows vLLM's stream convention,
Apache-2.0, without copying either implementation.

GLM's CUDA engine implements transformers' `models/glm5_next/modular_glm5_next.py` math, Apache-2.0,
without including that source. Its draft inputs and thinking-off rendering follow the public GLM recipe
from Mia-AiLab without including recipe code.

GLM EXL3 (`families/glm5_next/cuda/exl3.py`, `exl3.cu`, `exl3_mm.py`), the shared EXL3 module
(`src/tensorfold/cuda/exl3/`) and the EXL3 loaders of Qwen3.8-27B and Qwen3.8 Flash Next
(`families/qwen3_5/cuda/exl3_load.py`, `families/qwen4_exp/cuda/exl3.py`) read
[ExLlamaV3](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3)'s EXL3 format: its trellis layout and bitstream, its
"3inst", "mcg" and "mul1" codebooks, its half-integer bit widths and its tensor-core fragment order. Flash
Next's packs also carry ExLlamaV3's n-gram row codec, read as its `ngram_dequant` reads it. ExLlamaV3 uses the
MIT License, Copyright © 2025 Turboderp. TensorFold's decoders and kernels are separate implementations,
checked bit for bit against ExLlamaV3's dequantization.

Flash Next's optional int8 and int4 KV caches (`families/qwen4_exp/cuda/kvcache.py`) follow the cache quantization scheme of [ExLlamaV3](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3) `-cq 8` and `-cq 4` (MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025 Turboderp, text below): groups of 32, one fp16 absmax scale per group, the group rotated by a 32-point Hadamard, midpoint-grid codes, `compand_a == 0`. 8-bit stores each code as a signed int8 (`q - 128`). 4-bit stores two unsigned codes per byte, low nibble first (the same bits as ExLlamaV3's little-endian packing, a uint8 tensor rather than their uint32 words). Their dequantizer folds another `1/sqrt(32)` into the scale and applies the unnormalized butterfly on the way out; this cache applies the normalized H32 to the query and to the merged output instead, and leaves the stored codes rotated. Scales match their quantizer bit for bit. Reconstructed values agree within fp16/bf16 rounding (under 0.01 on random groups), not bit for bit. The quantizer and the attention dequant are written for TensorFold and checked against an independent reference of that arithmetic.

## DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash on CUDA (TP2)

This section was added by the fork that adds the `deepseek_v41` family; see `NOTICE`. The family
(`src/tensorfold/families/deepseek_v41/`), its reference model (`tools/dsv41/ref/`) and the RDMA gather
(`src/tensorfold/cuda/rdma.py`, `rdma_gather.cu`) are written for TensorFold. What they follow:

- The model math (compressed-KV attention and the lightning indexer, the compressor, mHC with Sinkhorn, Engram
  hashing, the MoE gate, the DSpark forward, the FP8/FP4 quantization rules) is re-implemented from DeepSeek's
  inference code for DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash (`inference/model.py`, `engram.py`, `kernel.py` in
  [deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash)) and its tech report,
  MIT License, Copyright (c) 2023 DeepSeek, without including that source.
- The DSML tool-call parsing in `src/tensorfold/cuda/reply_text.py` follows the format that DeepSeek's encoding and
  chat template for the model write (MIT License, Copyright (c) 2023 DeepSeek), without including that source.
- Upstream [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)'s `deepseek_v41` model code (Apache-2.0, Copyright
  contributors to the vLLM project) was read only as a cross-check of that math. No code is taken from it.
- The grouped EXL3 expert kernel additions (`src/tensorfold/cuda/exl3/experts_grouped.cuh`, `experts.cu`) follow
  [ExLlamaV3](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3)'s EXL3 format, MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025 Turboderp
  (text below), as the rest of the shared EXL3 module does.
- The baseline used in `tools/dsv41/REPORT.md` (a vLLM kit under AGPL-3.0) was only run as a black box over HTTP. None
  of its code was read or included. `tools/dsv41/ATTRIBUTION.md` lists every source in full.

## Vendored code and weights

`src/tensorfold/drafters/vendor/z_lab_dflash/model_mlx.py` is the unmodified `dflash/model_mlx.py` from
[z-lab/dflash](https://github.com/z-lab/dflash), MIT License, Copyright © 2026 Z Lab.

`src/tensorfold/families/deepseek_v4/vendor/encoding_dsv4.py` is the unmodified `encoding/encoding_dsv4.py` of
[deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash) (revision 60d8d70), and
`tests/fixtures/deepseek_v4/` holds two of its test cases, MIT License, Copyright (c) 2023 DeepSeek.
The MTP layer TensorFold drafts with comes from that checkpoint's last shard (MIT), converted by
`families/deepseek_v4/convert.py`.

TensorFold ships no model weights. The `z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2` model card states Apache-2.0.
The optional `incoai/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2` model card states CC BY-NC-ND 4.0, for non-commercial use
without derivatives. Each checkpoint keeps its own license.

## Flash Next CUDA image integration

The multimodal rotary and image-feature integration is adapted from MiaAI-Lab's
[Flash Next vision patch 0008](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Single-DGX-Spark-TensorFold/blob/a3aa89835022c55ca8e55008c37785954834e04f/patches/0008-flash-next-vision.patch),
MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 MiaAI-Lab. The license is included in `LICENSES/MiaAI-Lab-MIT.txt`.
The port preserves the v0.5 CUDA execution APIs and adds an offline EXL3 vision adapter.


## Local Bertholomus serving extensions

The DSML reply parser and its tests, and the strict tool grammar portions of
`engine/grammar.py`, are adapted from urtho/TensorFold revision
`27404275d0f14bba8e97e7ca801de4c956d369be`. The parser and grammar adapters
originate in Jay Leaton's DeepSeek/GLM Spark serving code, MIT License,
Copyright (c) 2026 Jay Leaton and TensorFold contributors. Source notices are
preserved; the license is included in `LICENSES/JayLeaton-MIT.txt`. The CUDA
server's DSML integration follows the same urtho revision; unrelated server
changes are not imported. xgrammar's built-in DeepSeek-V4.1 structural tag is
used through its API (Apache-2.0).

The capacity-test fixture `tests/fixtures/deepseek_v41/config.json` is the
pinned Mia EXL3 checkpoint configuration, revision
`64ba41b6c916a587db06eae2e19b7845f7be6e6b`, based on DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash
(MIT License, Copyright (c) 2023 DeepSeek). It contains configuration only.

`cuda/carveout.py` is adapted from urtho/TensorFold revision
`27404275d0f14bba8e97e7ca801de4c956d369be` (Apache-2.0). It independently
implements the Linux DRM and CUDA driver APIs, crediting Emi/coolbho3k's idea
of using GB10 display-reserved memory for sparse KV reads. No AGPL source from
`display_kv.c` is copied; the source attribution is retained in the module.

The bounded decode-width policy and widest-first warm-up in
`deepseek_v41/cuda/graph_budget.py`, `rounds.py` and `multi.py` follow the approach
in urtho/TensorFold revision `8b05ee70ef2891c579ce7f3292a65dfd39fe600c`,
`cuda/serial.py` and `cuda/engine.py` (Apache-2.0). Its accounting for CUDA graph
driver memory and use of PyTorch expandable segments inform the deployment's
memory qualification. The implementation retains Bertholomus' kernels, split
Engram graphs, vision path and speculative verification.
