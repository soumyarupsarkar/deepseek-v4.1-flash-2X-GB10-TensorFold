# Attribution: the `deepseek_v41` family

The original account below describes Bertholomus's family implementation. Local
deployment additions and later selective ports are identified separately here
and in [`deployment/COMPARISON.md`](../../deployment/COMPARISON.md#attribution).

## Local selective v0.5 port, October 2026

Soumyarup Sarkar's deployment ports compact host token histories, cosine/sine-only
RoPE tables, exact pruned top-k selection, candidate-only index scoring, invisible
attention-tile skipping, grouped-expert work lists and prompt scratch reductions
from [Bertholomus's v0.5 release](https://github.com/bertholomus/TensorFold/commit/508bfb34743f88d35abcb514f7013ef531ce34a5),
reviewed at commit `808eb4a1090ca7b79173cc2c799de16da5f923e3`. The associated upstream
correctness probes are retained under `tools/dsv41/`. Existing license and author
notices remain in place.

The local adaptation bounds positional tables by the request limit, retains the
explicit 32/64-row decode workspace and bounded graph/checkpoint policies, and
uses the existing switchable shared round outputs. It does not merge the entire
TensorFold 0.6.6 framework or enable the upstream experimental MMA/mHC paths.
[`UPSTREAM-V05.md`](../../deployment/UPSTREAM-V05.md) records the adaptation,
source pins, measurements, rejected settings and rollback. Performance credits
for the imported kernels belong to Bertholomus and the credited TensorFold/EXL3
contributors; local serving results are measurements of the combined system.

## Original family provenance

The `deepseek_v41` family of this TensorFold fork (`src/tensorfold/families/deepseek_v41/`, the RDMA gather in
`src/tensorfold/cuda/rdma.py` and `rdma_gather.cu`, and `tools/dsv41/`) was written independently. It is clean-room
with respect to the MiaAI-Lab vLLM kit (AGPL-3.0, only run as a black box) and the jayleaton recipe (never opened).
The model math was re-implemented from DeepSeek's MIT inference code and tech report, which we did read; no code was
copied. This file lists every outside source we used, what we took from it, how, and under which license. Ideas and
common techniques we built ourselves are not listed. `NOTICE` at the repository root lists the upstream files this
fork changes; `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` has a section for this family.

## Rules we kept

- The model math comes from reading DeepSeek's own MIT inference code and the DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash tech report. We
  re-implemented it. No code was copied.
- The tensor-parallel split, caches, collectives, kernels and server integration are ours (`DESIGN.md` in this
  folder).
- The MiaAI-Lab vLLM kit (AGPL-3.0) was only run as a black box, to measure baseline numbers through its HTTP API. We
  did not read, copy or adapt any of its code. We read the configuration file it was deployed with (settings and
  comments, not code) only to describe its settings in `REPORT.md`.
- A public recipe by jayleaton for running this model on TensorFold exists. We never opened it, and we did not tune
  toward its numbers.
