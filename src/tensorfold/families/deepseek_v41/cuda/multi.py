"""DeepSeek-V4.1's concurrent decoding (``--parallel N``): up to N requests on the lane at once, every live stream's
verify windows in graph-safe forwards, each reply exactly its solo run.

- **Pool.** One cache plane a layer holds every slot (``Model.new_pool``). A stream's prompt fills its slot through
  the single-stream path on the slot's views, so its prompt bits are the solo prompt's. (v1: the whole prompt fills at
  admission, between rounds.)
- **Rounds.** Every live stream's pending token and drafts go through one forward (``rounds.RoundRunner``): each row
  at its own position and slot. Every kernel is row-invariant, the cache kernels read each row's own stream and
  selection is a total order, so a row's logits are the solo run's at that position, and each stream samples its own
  rows by its own rule: its reply is its solo reply, whatever else runs beside it. Each forward holds TF_DS_DECODE_ROWS rows (up to 64); opt-in verification
  batching permits multiple forwards in one round. Depth comes from ``DEPTH_BY`` and the live stream count.
- **Drafts.** Each stream's DSpark drafter runs on its slot's own drafter cache (a captured graph a slot). Drafts
  only propose: they change speed, never a reply.
- **Ranks.** Rank 0 schedules (``tensorfold.cuda.scheduler``) and sends each step to the followers over a TCP link
  (``Link``) before running it; every rank checks the step's digest with one small all-gather before its model
  collectives (``OutOfStep``: the step fails on every rank at the same point). ``Watchdog``: a lost rank breaks the
  lane on every rank instead of hanging it.
- **Kept prompts** (``TF_DS_KEEP``). A finished stream's prompt stays in the window (``Kept``): its extent's rows up
  to its last kept chunk boundary, and its slot's rings at its kept boundaries (the window keys and compressor inputs
  are a slot's, not an extent's). A later prompt that starts the same continues from the longest boundary they share:
  its rows are copied into its own extent (or it grows the kept extent in place), the rings come back, and its chunks
  from there are a fresh prefill's own chunks, so its reply is the fresh reply; usage's ``cached_tokens`` is that
  boundary. Only prompt rows are kept (a verify round's rows are not a prompt chunk's bits); with replay prefill the
  boundary stays a window below the prompt's end (the decoder layers' rows there are the prompt's own). Kept entries
  give their room back, oldest first, whenever an admission needs it.

Ported from our GLM-5.3 fork's ``glm_moe_dsa/cuda/multi.py`` (the same design, pipeline/CONCURRENCY-DESIGN.md).
Structured output uses one masked target token per round; unconstrained streams
retain drafting. Logprobs are not served with ``--parallel``.
